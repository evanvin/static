# Recipe Maker

## Purpose

I began my kitchen recipe collection/ogranization by typing recipes on 4x6 index cards on my typewriter.

This started to become a hassle when I would store my typewriter away when not using it (which is often).

So until I get a bigger workshop area where I can keep the typewriter out all the time, 
this project generates the recipe cards in the style and format I like to be printed out by a printer.

## Interesting Tidbits

I wanted the font to look like a typewriter, not just in style, but in wear, to match analog typewriter aesthetics. So I used the following special font.

> The main problem is that an analog typewriter is incapable of producing the same output every time.
